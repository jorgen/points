"""Shared schema constants for the dewfall binding IR (dew_api.json).

The IR has two layers:
  raw      -- faithful libclang extraction of the public C headers
  semantic -- derived object-oriented view (classes, methods, roles) that
              every generator consumes; it never mentions a target language

Bump IR_VERSION when the schema shape changes incompatibly.
